These columns suggest a dynamic growth rate due to continuous user input or system updates, such as new tasks being created, assigned, or updated.\n3.  The foreign key relationships with other tables (e.g., `initiatives.id`, `employees.id`) further support this classification, as they imply connections between different business entities.\n\nWhile the table does contain some static-like columns like `id` and `is_priority`, which could be seen as system definitions or configuration, the overall structure and content of the table lean towards a dynamic classification.",

Here's why:\n\n1.  The presence of a foreign key (`kpi_id`) referencing another table (`kpis.id`) suggests that this table is related to business entities or activity.\n2.  The columns `recorded_value`, `checkin_date`, and `comment_text` imply that the table stores data about user interactions, events, or transactions.\n3.  The fact that these columns are not explicitly defined as system definitions or configuration settings further supports the classification as **DYNAMIC**.\n\nThe only reason I didn't assign a confidence of 1.0 is because there's no explicit product description to confirm the purpose of this table. However, based on the schema alone, it appears to be related to business entities and activity, which aligns with the characteristics of a **DYNAMIC** table.",

However, since we don't have any information about these fields, I assumed they would be generated separately.\n4. **date_of_birth**: Since it's a string column with a max length of 10, I used the generic fallback for string type columns and added a hint to generate a date within the last century.\n\nNote that I didn't use any dependencies since there are none provided in the input.

This will allow the prompt to select a random value from the `departments` table.\n* `full_name`: Use rule 3 to infer that this is a string column with no specific type, so generate a full name for the provider with first and last names.\n* `specialty`: Since it's an optional field (nullable), use rule 3 to infer that this is a string column.
